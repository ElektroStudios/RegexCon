# RegexCon for Windows

## What is RegexCon?
*RegexCon* is a simple utility to perform a Regular Expression substitution.

*RegexCon* is focused in .Net regex pattern syntax usage, this means it supports the powerfull Regex motor at the moment, and any common pattern syntax of other languages will work too, but be aware that programming languages has their own RegEx imlementations whith minor changes (and/or limitations) in their syntax, for example a PHP named group is not written in the same way as in .Net, the syntax adaptation is responsability of the end-user.

## When to use it?
This tool could be used in a for-loop of any language to perform file renamings.

I personally use *RegexCon* as a life-saver in a 3rd party file renamer that is written in a language that has RegEx limitations, but it support external apps, so I run **RegexCon** to support this lack by letting my app perform the regex substitution.

Sure you could find another scenario on which this tool will be usefull for you!
